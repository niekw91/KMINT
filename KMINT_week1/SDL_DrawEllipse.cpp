* SDL_Surface 32-bit circle-fill algorithm without using trig
*
* While I humbly call this "Celdecea's Method", odds are that the
* procedure has already been documented somewhere long ago.  All of
* the circle-fill examples I came across utilized trig functions or
* scanning neighbor pixels.  This algorithm identifies the width of
* a semi-circle at each pixel height and draws a scan-line covering
* that width.
*
* The code is not optimized but very fast, owing to the fact that it
* alters pixels in the provided surface directly rather than through
* function calls.
*
* WARNING:  This function does not lock surfaces before altering, so
* use SDL_LockSurface in any release situation.
